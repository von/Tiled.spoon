# Tiler.spoon
Side-by-side window tiling

Taken from [@megalthic](https://github.com/megalithic/dotfiles/blob/master/hammerspoon/hammerspoon.symlink/bindings/movewindows.lua) who apparently got if from @evantravers, who got it from @tmiller. Converted to a spoon by @von.

Allows choosing a second window to tile next to the focused window.
