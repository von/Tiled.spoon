# Tiler.spoon
Side-by-side window tiling

Taken from [@megalthic](https://github.com/megalithic/dotfiles/blob/master/hammerspoon/hammerspoon.symlink/bindings/movewindows.lua) who apparently got it from @evantravers, who got it from @tmiller. Converted to a spoon by @von. For a demo see, http://evantravers.com/articles/2020/06/12/hammerspoon-handling-windows-and-layouts/

Allows choosing a second window to tile next to the focused window.
